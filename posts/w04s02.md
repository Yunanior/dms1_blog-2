**Security**

After I finished 20 sketched, I thought the row 1 column1( r1c1), r2c2 is most effective.

When I think about security, “Lock” is the thing I can’t skip. And r1c1 is a typical lock in life, and it has been locked, which makes people feel safe. Also, the shape is square, which is stable from visual , also gives people a feeling of reliable.

R2c2, a safety door, also higher way to keep something safe, which express the topic in a powerful way,
