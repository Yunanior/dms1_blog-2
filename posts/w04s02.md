## Thumbnail Sketches Practice

**Security**

After I finished 20 sketched, I thought the row 1 column1( r1c1), r2c2 is most effective.

When I think about security, “Lock” is the thing I can’t skip. And r1c1 is a typical lock in life, and it has been locked, which makes people feel safe. Also, the shape is square, which is stable from visual , also gives people a feeling of reliable.

R2c2, a safety door, also higher way to keep something safe, which express the topic in a powerful way,



## Concepts

**Tape**

The appearances of Tapes don’t have a lot of differences , so i designed them with some different style, and trying add some things have relative whit them. 

No.2 is final design, which is between realism and flat design. And No2 also express “tape” clearly, but In the produce part I combined No2 wit no1 a little bit.
