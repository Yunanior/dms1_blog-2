## Thumbnail Sketches Practice

![Sketches](/w04s01/20quick%20sketches.png)

**Security**

After I finished 20 sketched, I thought the row 1 column1( r1c1), r2c2 is most effective.

When I think about security, “Lock” is the thing I can’t skip. And r1c1 is a typical lock in life, and it has been locked, which makes people feel safe. Also, the shape is square, which is stable from visual , also gives people a feeling of reliable.

R2c2, a safety door, also higher way to keep something safe, which express the topic in a powerful way,



## Concepts

![concept1](/w04s02/concept1.png)

**Tape**

 For this icon, the function is when user click on it. It can get into the list of the audio user recording before. 
 At first, I was hesitant between No1 and No2, but finally I chose No2 because it have some sense of space. And because of that I can do more color change in the follow steps. No3 also is a good one  but it is too complex, which not fit the idea of clear and simple.


![concept2](/w04s02/concept2.png)

**Album**

This Icon is use for get into the photo album in the application, so I want it have a movement of flipping the album.

No2 is my final design, it shows the pattern is album clearly from visual side. It is better than No1 and No5, because it doesn’t need the word to show it’s an album. And is can do some thickness changing, which also fit our the design has been chosen before.

![concept3](/w04s02/concept3.png)

**Gift**

This icon is use for gift memory, people can exchange their greeting cards and gift by 
this function.

Thinking about gift, the pattern of square packages gets into my mind, but I feel is too common. So I gave up all the design with gift pattern, and change to a more euphemistic way—the card. Finally, I chose No2, cause the design is not that similar with my other design(No5 looks similar as the album design.)

![concept4](/w04s02/concept4.png)

**Camera**

This icon is use for taking photos, after pressing it the photo gonna come out like instant film from the external devices.

Camera is a  common elements in flat design, and it is hard to have a lot of change in design it because it is too specific and everyone can image a camera in their mind. I tried design for the camera models from different era. And finally I chose No3, the pattern of the camera models most people have used.

![concept5](/w04s02/concept5.png)

**Map**

The function of this pattern is marking the place user has been to for a trip, and the main design is around “Map”.

And in the final, I chose No3 because is can easily change into a flat style. And another reason is , this icon have a feeling of “ I’m recording my trip” , which other design don’t have. 

![concept6](/w04s02/concept6.png)

**Game**

This icon is us for get into the game in the application. The games are for party and trip in group. 

Finally, I chose to combine No3 and No4 in the final design, the puzzle and a dice. The design idea is more like table game, because table game is more focus on real life which fit the application idea

![concept7](/w04s02/concept7.png)

**Food**

The function of the icon is help people record their Owen family recipe and exchange their recipes.

For my final design, I chose No2, This choice is grounded in the context of family traditions and daily routines.Milk and bread are staples in many households, representing comfort and they also evoke a sense of familiarity and warmth.

![concept8](/w04s02/concept8.png)

**Plan**

The function this icon is around planning daily life and activities.

In final design, I chose No1. This pattern show a calendar people can see in daily life.  
It emphasises the application's role in helping families coordinate activities, events, and tasks, fostering a sense of order and harmony in their daily lives.

![concept9](/w04s02/concept9.png)

**Drawn**

This icon is for people who don’t know what they should do next, and click the button is will randomly drawn a thing people want to do( all the things from all the users recored and chose shared in the app.)

So random is important in this design, and finally I chose No2— a gum machine, even it is not that common nowadays, but there still a lot of people have memory with it. And the color of gum is random which express the Idea clearly.
