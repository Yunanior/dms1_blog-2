## Tracing Activity

This painting was painted by using pen tool . And it was the first time I worked on such a big pattern by using Illustrator , so the final result was not that satisfying. 

But during the time I was working  on this image, I found a way to distill the shape. The main Idea is: distilling the shape of the main object and the colors which have high contrast. And another important thing is giving up the details which are too tiny.

In this image, the house and the lighthouse are the main objects. Even though they are the key object, they didn't take that huge place in the whole image. 

So I chose to start from the background. And the different tones between the colors gave me an easy way to distill their shapes. So I chose 4 colors to show the tone. The basic logic is figuring the dark green parts to show the shadow, and figuring the light green parts to show the bright spots. 

After the background colors have been added, I go back to working on the main object part, I figure the outlines of them, and then draw the shadows of them with the same color.

 Finally, about the details in the dark I chose to give them up because they make the whole image too messy.
