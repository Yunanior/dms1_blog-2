## Tracing Activity

![pen tool](/w04s02/edhopper_lighthousehill%20[Recovered].png)

This painting was painted by pen tool . And it was the first time I worked on such a big pattern by using Illustrator , so the final result was not that satisfying. 

But during the time I was working  on this image, I found a way to distill the shape. The main Idea is: distilling the shape of the main object and the colors which have high contrast. And another important thing is giving up the details which are too tiny.

In this image, the house and the lighthouse are the main objects. Even though they are the key object, they didn't take that huge place in the whole image. 

So I chose to start from the background. And the different tones between the colors gave me an easy way to distill their shapes. So I chose 4 colors to show the tone. The basic logic is figuring the dark green parts to show the shadow, and figuring the light green parts to show the bright spots. 

After the background colors have been added, I go back to working on the main object part, I figure the outlines of them, and then draw the shadows of them with the same color.

 Finally, about the details in the dark I chose to give them up because they make the whole image too messy.

The second one was painted by shape tool, because of the experience from the last image, I started to become familiar with the method of distilling shapes and the color choices.

Different from the last image, this image is orderly, so I chose to build this one into four parts, the sky part, the second floor part, the store part, and the ground part. But each part still followed the distill steps, I figured the based shape and then added the main object to it. After that, I added the shadows on them.

About the details, I draw the objects in the front( fire hydrant， hair salon light) in detail,  and gave up the things in the shadow.
