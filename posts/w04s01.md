About the training, it helped me a lot to get familiar with the Adobe Illustrator functions. Especially, the lesson about selection tools save  a lot of time for me to edit and manage these black squares. In addition, the lesson about shape and line tools give me more thoughts about how to placing and combine four black squares. 


## Design Thinking

   Design thinking helps me a lot to started a new program, which also makes my mind more clear. 
    So, after I chose my assignment topic—“Memory” —I started thinking about my audience. Everyone have“Memory” , which mean my audience are a lot. And I chose focus on people who love recored and review their life, such as people who love writing diaries and people who often film family tapes.
    To make a people start thinking about their past lives, always need the help of five senses.After a quick brainstorm, a thought of five senses diary coming into my mind, which recored the special moments from different sides and help people touch the memory more easily. 
    Because of the main idea is make people recored and review life easily, so I chose the iPhone as a platform, and the icons will be used in the guiding page.
